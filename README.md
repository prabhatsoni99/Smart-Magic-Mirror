Our project also included Google Assistant - a very cool thing

We implemented it parallely with this code & Google Asst. had no relation with this code

Check out this on how to implement Google Asst. in a device:-

Dependencies you must install in order for this code to work:-

sudo apt-get install python-imaging-tk

sudo pip3 install geocoder

pip3 install --upgrade google-api-python-client
