# Smart-Magic Mirror

# Notice!
Our Gmail API and Google Calender API are not working as of now. They seem to have expired.
We plan to fix them soon.

# Reference: HackerShack's Smart Mirror

This is an excellent starter code! Though I might argue ours is better ;)

# Implementation
- ```Tkinter``` library in Python to provide GUI
- Used APIs like Gmail, Google Calender, BBC News API to fetch data
- Various data from API are updated on the screen every few seconds

# Google Assistant
- Google Assistant. Unrelated to the ```MagicMirror.py``` script though
- The ```MagicMirror.py``` script ran in parallel with the Google Assistant script

# How To Use

1. Install the dependencies.
```$ ./install_dependencies.sh```
2. Execute
```$ ./execute-me.sh```
In our case, we also executed another script (Google Assistant script) alongside the main script.
If you want to run another script parallely, open another Terminal, and run the 2nd script there.

# Credentials

Please avoid messing around with the credentials of the e-mail.
You are free to send mails to this e-mail, make new Calender events, etc.
